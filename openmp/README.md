### Description

We will work with high performance computing using Fortran with OpenMP.
We will produce subroutines which can be easily compiled on Windows, Mac, and
Ubuntu operating systems. We will demonstrate the excellent speed ups which
can be obtained by using Fortran with the OpenMP directives.
